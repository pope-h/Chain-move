# ChainMove

ChainMove is a mobility finance platform being positioned for the Stellar blockchain. It combines fractional vehicle ownership, pay-to-own driver financing, investor pool management, and operations tooling for a transport finance marketplace.

The repository currently contains the application layer: onboarding, authentication, internal wallets, pool investing flows, payment rails, dashboards, and backend APIs. The Stellar integration layer is the next major product milestone.

## Why ChainMove

Informal transport financing is still fragmented in many markets. Drivers face high daily settlement pressure, operators lack transparent records, and investors struggle to access structured, verifiable mobility assets.

ChainMove addresses that gap with:

- asset-backed investment pools for transport vehicles
- pay-to-own driver workflows with clearer repayment visibility
- wallet-enabled onboarding for non-technical users
- internal wallet and payment rails for recurring funding flows
- admin and reporting surfaces for platform operations
- a planned Stellar-backed record of ownership, repayments, payouts, and governance activity

## Why Stellar

Stellar is the intended blockchain home for ChainMove because its network model fits payment-heavy, asset-backed finance workflows:

- issued assets can represent vehicle pool interests, repayment receipts, or platform settlement instruments
- fast, low-cost payments are suitable for frequent contributions, repayments, and investor distributions
- Stellar Testnet provides a stable development path before moving production flows to Mainnet
- Horizon and Stellar RPC can support ledger reads, payment history, and smart contract interactions
- Soroban smart contracts can enforce ownership, payout, treasury, and governance logic
- Stellar anchors and ecosystem standards provide a path for regulated fiat on-ramps and off-ramps when the platform is ready

## Current Product Surface

The current codebase already supports a meaningful offchain and wallet-enabled product:

- investor flows for browsing pools, funding wallets, tracking positions, and viewing governance token screens
- driver flows for onboarding, repayment tracking, and ownership progression
- admin views for users, investors, reports, KYC, and fleet operations
- Privy-based authentication with embedded wallet provisioning
- Paystack-backed fiat funding into an internal NGN wallet
- Paystack dedicated virtual accounts for driver repayment collection
- MongoDB-backed APIs for pools, investments, transactions, and user state

## Stellar Alignment Note

This README reflects the target Stellar direction of the project.

### Wallet Abstraction Layer

The codebase now includes a wallet abstraction layer that separates authentication, application identity, and blockchain account management. This abstraction:

- Provides a clean API for wallet and account operations
- Supports multiple blockchain accounts per user (Stellar, EVM, embedded wallets)
- Allows seamless network switching between Stellar Testnet, Mainnet, and transitional chains
- Isolates EVM/Lisk-specific code for easier future removal
- Prepares the foundation for full Stellar wallet and transaction support

See `docs/WALLET_ABSTRACTION.md` for architecture details and `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for usage examples.

### Current State

The full Stellar integration is not yet wired end-to-end in this repository. The app still contains temporary EVM-oriented wallet plumbing through `Privy`, `viem`, and Lisk Sepolia configuration, and `package.json` still includes non-Stellar chain dependencies. Those pieces are now isolated through the wallet abstraction and will be removed when the Stellar wallet, asset, and smart contract layer lands.

In practical terms:

- the product and backend foundations are here
- wallet abstraction layer provides structure for Stellar integration
- Stellar asset issuance, account flows, payout tracking, and Soroban contracts are the next chain layer
- README language, roadmap, and contribution guidance below are written for the Stellar path

### Wallet modes

Wallet and chain assumptions live in `lib/wallet/config.ts`; UI-facing wallet shapes live in
`lib/wallet/types.ts`.

- **Current mode — Privy embedded wallet:** Privy remains the authentication and embedded-wallet
  provider. New users receive an EVM wallet on Lisk Sepolia, preserving the existing signup,
  provider, and funding flows.
- **Planned mode — Stellar account:** a linked `stellarPublicKey` is displayed as a Stellar Testnet
  account in wallet/profile surfaces. This display path is separate from authentication and does
  not replace Privy.
- **No linked wallet:** public wallet display helpers return a neutral “Not linked” state instead
  of leaking chain-specific fallback assumptions into components.

When Stellar signing is introduced, add it behind the planned mode rather than changing Privy
authentication or scattering network constants through UI components.

## Local Development

This repository contains both `package-lock.json` and `bun.lock`. `npm` is the safest default unless your team is standardizing on Bun.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Obiajulu-gif/chain_move.git
cd chain_move
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env.local` and set the required variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=<your_privy_app_id>
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=<your_privy_app_secret>
PRIVY_JWKS_URL=<your_privy_jwks_url>
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=<optional_if_testing_payments>
PAYSTACK_DVA_PREFERRED_BANK=<optional_paystack_bank_slug>
RESEND_API_KEY=<optional_if_testing_emails>
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Notes

- `MONGODB_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` are required for application and session state.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`, `PRIVY_APP_SECRET`, and `PRIVY_JWKS_URL` are required for the current Privy-backed auth flow.
- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` is required for wallet funding flows.
- `PAYSTACK_DVA_PREFERRED_BANK` optionally overrides the bank slug used when provisioning Paystack dedicated virtual accounts. For test keys, the app defaults to `test-bank`.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` is only needed for email features.
- Stellar variables are not required by the current code yet. The expected integration pass should introduce explicit values such as `STELLAR_NETWORK`, `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL`, `STELLAR_RPC_URL`, issuer account public keys, distribution account public keys, and contract IDs.

## Driver Dedicated Repayment Accounts

Drivers with an active hire-purchase contract can receive a Paystack dedicated virtual account in the repayment center.

- the account is provisioned automatically when the driver loads the repayment center and has the required profile fields
- bank transfers into that account are matched to the driver's active contract through the Paystack webhook
- overpayments still apply only up to the contract balance, with any excess credited to the driver's internal balance
- the existing Paystack checkout repayment flow remains available as a fallback if provisioning fails or the driver cannot use bank transfer
- investors can also receive a dedicated Paystack account for internal wallet funding, with webhook-based auto-crediting into `availableBalance`

### Driver Profile Requirements

The dedicated virtual account flows currently require:

- email
- name / full name
- phone number

If Paystack DVA eligibility for the business requires additional customer identification beyond those fields, the app surfaces the upstream error and leaves the fallback checkout flow available.

## Suggested Stellar Integration Path

- replace temporary EVM/Lisk Sepolia wallet configuration with Stellar account and wallet support
- add Stellar Testnet configuration for Horizon, Stellar RPC, Friendbot-funded development accounts, and explorer links
- define issuer and distribution account strategy for ChainMove vehicle pool assets
- publish asset metadata through a domain-hosted `/.well-known/stellar.toml` before public asset listings
- add Soroban contracts for vehicle pool ownership, payout rules, treasury actions, and governance execution
- index payment, repayment, payout, and contract events from Horizon or Stellar RPC into MongoDB
- map Paystack fiat funding and repayment events to Stellar settlement records where compliance and product rules allow
- promote production settlement flows to Stellar Mainnet when contracts, custody, compliance, and monitoring are ready

## Contribution Guide

When contributing, keep changes small and explicit, and document whether your work affects:

- application UX
- backend and payment behavior
- wallet flows
- Stellar integration assumptions

If you touch chain-related code or docs, keep naming consistent with the target stack:

- use `Stellar Testnet` for development references
- use `Stellar Mainnet` for production references
- use `Soroban` for Stellar smart contract references
- avoid reintroducing stale Arbitrum, Lisk, or Solana positioning into product or architecture docs

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Roadmap

### Near-term

- finalize Stellar account and wallet integration strategy
- harden investor and driver onboarding flows
- improve pool investing and wallet funding UX
- add clearer payout and ownership reporting
- remove temporary non-Stellar chain dependencies once replacement code is ready

### Mid-term

- implement Stellar-backed pool assets and Soroban ownership contracts
- add automated payout and treasury accounting flows
- wire governance actions to onchain execution
- publish asset and organization metadata through `stellar.toml`
- improve analytics for investor transparency and driver repayment performance
